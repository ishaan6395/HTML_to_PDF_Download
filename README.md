# HTML_to_PDF_Download
Using Javascript what this program does is you can download a specific component of HTML to pdf

It takes the help of external libraries like jspdf and html2canvas. What you need to do is just change the name of the div you want
to download and the rest will be handled.
I would like to bring to attention that this is just a basic working you can use the javascript code and modify it the way you want 
your application to work.

Examples of it's use: -> If you want to download a dynamically generated page with only selected HTML components
                         you can do it using such libraries.
                      -> Save a picture in pdf using javascript.
